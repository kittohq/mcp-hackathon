# Auto-Remediation Security System Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines a comprehensive autonomous security remediation system designed to detect, analyze, and automatically respond to security threats in real-time. The system employs machine learning, threat intelligence, and predefined playbooks to minimize Mean Time To Respond (MTTR) while maintaining system stability and compliance.

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Core Components

#### Detection Engine
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of logs, network traffic, and system behaviors
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Consumption of external threat feeds (MISP, ThreatConnect, OpenCTI)
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based behavioral analysis using isolation forests and autoencoders
- **Event Correlation**: SIEM integration with custom correlation rules

#### Decision Engine
- **Risk Assessment Module**: Calculates threat severity and potential impact
- **Remediation Selector**: Chooses appropriate response based on threat type and context
- **Confidence Scoring**: ML model confidence threshold system (minimum 85% for autonomous action)
- **Escalation Logic**: Automatic human escalation for low-confidence or high-risk scenarios

#### Execution Engine
- **Orchestration Layer**: Integration with automation platforms (Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes operators)
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatic state capture and restoration capabilities
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable logging of all remediation actions
- **Safe Mode**: Manual override and emergency stop functionality

### 1.2 Data Flow Architecture

```
[Threat Sources] → [Detection Engine] → [Decision Engine] → [Execution Engine]
                            ↓                   ↓                    ↓
                    [Threat Database]   [Playbook Library]   [Action Logs]
                            ↑                   ↑                    ↑
                    [ML Training Pipeline] [Human Review]    [Audit System]
```

## 2. Detection Mechanisms

#### Application-Level Threats
- SQL injection attempts
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Remote code execution attempts
- API abuse and rate limit violations

#### Infrastructure Threats

### 2.2 Detection Methods

#### Signature-Based Detection

    business_impact * 0.25
) * confidence_factor
```
